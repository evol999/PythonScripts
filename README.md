# PythonScripts
Some scripts I made to save time in my current job, criticism is welcome. Detailed info:  
  
leveler.py ->  
The idea is to make the content of several different folders, the same, but only by copying different  
files. MD5 checksum is used to determine differences.  
  
Packer.py ->  
I want this to be a package generator for Telium+ Ingenico terminals. Is not operative yet, but this  
is the first step. I DO NOT OWN Ingenico Telium SDK, hence it won't be provided here. But you could       
use this as a base for something you need.  
  
ToHighcase ->  
Simple script to rename all files in a folder to uppercased names.
